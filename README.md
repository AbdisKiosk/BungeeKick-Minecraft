BungeeKick works kind of like [MoveMeNow](http://www.spigotmc.org/resources/movemenow.17/). When players are kicked from a proxied server, they are pushed to the lobby instead of quitting the session, and are given the kick reason as a message. BungeeKick doesnt have the Blacklist/Whitelist compatibility like MoveMeNow. You can try my Bukkit plugin [WhitelistPerm](http://www.spigotmc.org/resources/whitelistperm.1309/) for this.

    # This is where the player is kicked to. This is usually the lobby/hub server
    
    KickMessage: '&6You have been kicked! Reason: &2'
    
    # Message to be sent to the player who has been kicked. This message is followed by the kick reason
    
    ShowKickMessage: True
    
    # Set this to True if you want the kicked player to be able to see the kick reason.
